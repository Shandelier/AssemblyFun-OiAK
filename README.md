# AssemblyFun-OiAK

This repo exists in exchange for my tears, sweat, and blood. All my Assembler programs has been made with toil. 
Learning Asssembly comes with a price. Be aware of this, You who seek wisdom.

### How to use
You'll find scripts made by me (Karol KÅ‚usek), and my friends. (Choose your fighter:)
- Przemek has the cleanest code,
- Wodzu has the best commentaries,
- Kurek's code works.

If you find yourself in uneasy situation, there is also a meme-pack to wipe your tears away, alongside official Intel CPU's documentation.

Good Luck!
