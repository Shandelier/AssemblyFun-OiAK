# AssemblyFun-OiAK
This repo exists in exchange for my tears, sweat, and blood. All my Assembler programs has been made with toil. 
Learning Asssembly comes with a price. Be aware of this, You who seek wisdom.

## Why does this repo even exist?
On my major, there were this impossible to pass course -- Computer Architecture. Ive been so spooked by it I tried to gather all the best materials to not fail it. I organised an "event" for 20 people in library to learn basic Assembly before it even started. If you wasn't one of those lucky ones to atend this repo is for you ❤

## How to use
You'll find scripts made by me (Karol Kłusek), and my friends. (Choose your fighter:)
- Przemek has the cleanest code,
- Wodzu has the best commentaries,
- Kurek's code works.

If you find yourself in uneasy situation, there is also a meme-pack to wipe your tears away, alongside official Intel CPU's documentation.

Good Luck!
