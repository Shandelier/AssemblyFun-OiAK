# AssemblyFun-OiAK

This repo contains the price for my tears, sweat, and blood. All of this assembler programs has been made with toil. Learning asssembly comes with a price. Be aware of this, You who seek wisdom.

### How to use
You'll find programs made by me (Karol KÅ‚usek), as well my friends. (Choose your fighter:)
- Przemek has the cleanest code,
- Wodzu has the best commentaries,
- Kurek's codes work.

If you find yourself in uneasy situation, there is also a memepack to wipe your tears away, as well as some official Intel documentations.

Good Luck!
